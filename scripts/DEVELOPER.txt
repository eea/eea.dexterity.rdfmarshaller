Fast experimentation with surf/rdfmarshaller
============================================

Use the playground.py script to easily experiment with the surf.rdflib API. It has
an integrated environment and an easy to start example.

You can either run this script with the zopepy script from the EEA buildout, or create
a new virtualenv then install the dependencies: bin/pip install -r requirements
